# MATLAB App Designer Mini Project

This repository contains a mini project that demonstrates interaction with **MATLAB App Designer**. The project also includes operations on **matrices**, such as sum, product, square, square root, and absolute value calculations.

## Features

- Interactive MATLAB App using App Designer  
- Generate and display matrices  
- Perform basic matrix operations:  
  - Sum of elements  
  - Product of elements  
  - Square of the matrix  
  - Square root of the matrix  
  - Absolute value of the matrix  
- Display results in a clean, formatted style

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2020a or later (App Designer support required)  

## Usage

1. Open the project in MATLAB.  
2. Run the App Designer file (`*.mlapp`).  
3. Interact with the UI to generate matrices and calculate statistics.
